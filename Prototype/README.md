Instructions:
In order to test and run the Blockly-based demo for NotionWeb, please go to the Blockly link through Github. Once on the demo page, there are different tabs for the notion database, functions, MISC blocks, and HTML conversion blocks. With these blocks, the following can be done:
Creating paragraph blocks that take input text with options for headings, font, size, as well as changing color/italics/boling for text.
Creating ordered and unordered lists
Creating hyperlinks
Allowing users to add images to their notion page
Creating tables and checklists

In the demo particularly, the blocks can be nested together or placed individually. Then their functionality can be tested by pressing Generate Javascript which will output the HTML code that has been converted from Javascript to HTML.
