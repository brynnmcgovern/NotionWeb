## Project Overview:

### Short motivation and description of our project:
Our project will be using blockly to create a language that allows for elaboarate and useful designs to be made for the organizational tool Notion. This will be done via an underlying HTML implementation to directly produce customizable Notion tools. Notion is such a helpful rescource that allows users to create organizational structures from very simple designs to complex databases and functionality. The issue we saw is that to accomplish these complex tasks it can be less intuitive and may require exstensive time spent learning the application and many tutorials. Our motivation to creating this blockly language is to provide users a middle ground by giving them a visual tool, such as a block baised language, that will allow them to create endless implementations of notion concepts.

## how your project relates to the topics of parsing, interpretation and compilation:
Notion is mostly made up of JavaScript/HTML. We will incorporate Blockly for this project so that users can use Blockly to design task lists visually which means they can add due dates for assignments/tasks and add descriptions for them in order to organize everything. Example features would include adding tasks, deleting tasks, as well as creating custom blocks to create the specific task lists mentioned above. Our project relates to the topics of parsing, interpretation, and compilation because we are allowing users to create visual blocks for tasks through our NotionWeb, Blockly-based language.

## Future Work:
For future work, we would consider enhancing the functionality and user experience of your NotionWeb Blockly-based language. We would also implement features such as collaborative task list creation, real-time synchronization across multiple users, and integration with external calendar applications.

## Contributions:
Collaboratively, our team has been actively engaged in various aspects of the NotionWeb Blockly-based language project. Kayla contributed to the efforts of configuring the server to ensure smooth communication between Blockly and Notion in relation to the blocks. Zakari and Sreya have played roles in defining the essential blocks required for our Notion page with diverse functionalities needed for effective task list management. Meanwhile, Brynn has been focused on the technical implementation, creating the link to our Blockly page from Github and planning out the code structure for the blocks. The team, comprising Kayla, Sreya, Zakari, and Brynn, has collectively collaborated on the customblocks.js document. Each team member's contributions reflect a coordinated effort to seamlessly integrate visual block creation for task lists on NotionWeb using Blockly. We also all worked on the videos for the project.
