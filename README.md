#short motivation and description of the project:
Our project will be using blockly to create a language that allows for elaboarate and useful designs to be made for the organizational tool notion. This will be done via an underlying HTML implementation to directly produces Notion tools. Notion is such a helpful rescource that allows users to create organizational structures from very simple designs to complex tasks. The issue we saw is that to accomplish these complex tasks it can be less intuitive and require exstensive time spent learning the application and many tutorials. Our motivation to creating this blockly language is to provide users a middle ground by giving them a visual tool, such as a block baised language, that will allow them to create endless implementations of notion concepts.
