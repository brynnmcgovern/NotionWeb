# Project Overview:

#Short motivation and description of our project:
Our project will be using blockly to create a language that allows for elaboarate and useful designs to be made for the organizational tool Notion. This will be done via an underlying HTML implementation to directly produce customizable Notion tools. Notion is such a helpful rescource that allows users to create organizational structures from very simple designs to complex databases and functionality. The issue we saw is that to accomplish these complex tasks it can be less intuitive and may require exstensive time spent learning the application and many tutorials. Our motivation to creating this blockly language is to provide users a middle ground by giving them a visual tool, such as a block baised language, that will allow them to create endless implementations of notion concepts.

#how your project relates to the topics of parsing, interpretation and compilation:
Notion is mostly made up of JavaScript/HTML. We will incorporate Blockly for this project so that users can use Blockly to design task lists visually which means they can add due dates for assignments/tasks and add descriptions for them in order to organize everything. Example features would include adding tasks, deleting tasks, as well as creating custom blocks to create the specific task lists mentioned above. Our project relates to the topics of parsing, interpretation, and compilation because we are allowing users to create visual blocks for tasks through our NotionWeb, Blockly-based language.
