# Explain how you divided the work between group members
## Developing the Blockly Code/Prototype (Kayla and Brynn):
- Split the development tasks into manageable parts. For example, Kayla can focus on the core functionality and interaction with the Notion API, while Brynn can concentrate on UI customization, automation, and triggers.
- Collaborate closely to ensure consistency in design, style, and communication between different parts of the Blockly code.
- Test each other's code and provide feedback for improvements.
- Handle integration between different components to ensure they work seamlessly together.


## Outlining Pseudocode and Planning and Writing Documentation (Sreya and Zakari ):
### Document the Blockly prototype comprehensively, documenting the following : 
- A clear overview of the project's purpose and goals.
- Step-by-step instructions on how to use the Blockly prototype.
- Descriptions of each custom block's functionality, including input parameters and expected outputs.
- Examples and use cases to help users understand how to achieve various tasks with the prototype.
- Any known issues or limitations.
- Ensure the documentation is up-to-date with any changes or improvements to the Blockly code.
### Create detailed pseudocode for each of the project's major components, such as:
- Pseudocode for the "getNotionDatabase" function.
- Pseudocode for the database operations (create, update, delete).
- Pseudocode for UI customization tasks.
- Pseudocode for automation and trigger setup.
- Pseudocode for the recursive task list generation.
- Plan the overall project structure and flow, ensuring that each custom block's purpose aligns with the pseudocode.
- Define a coding style guide and naming conventions to maintain consistency in the Blockly code.
- Coordinate with Brynn and Kayla to ensure that the pseudocode accurately represents the intended functionality.
